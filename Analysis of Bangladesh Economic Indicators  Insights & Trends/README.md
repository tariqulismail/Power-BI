# Analysis of Bangladesh Economic Indicators  Insights & Trends



### Introduction

Integrating Python with Power BI can enhance your data analysis by allowing to perform advanced analysis, data manipulation, and machine learning directly within your Power BI reports. Below is an outline for conducting an economic indicators analysis of Bangladesh using Python within Power BI.

The objective of this data science project is to analyze key economic indicators of Bangladesh, identify trends, and provide insights into the country's economic performance over time. The project aims to use data science techniques to uncover patterns and predict future economic trends, aiding in policy-making and economic planning.


 

### 1. Objective
The objective of this data science project is to analyze key economic indicators of Bangladesh, identify trends, and provide insights into the country's economic performance over time. The project aims to use data science techniques to uncover patterns and predict future economic trends, aiding in policy-making and economic planning.

### 2. Data Collection
•	Sources: World Bank, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), International Monetary Fund (IMF), Trading Economics, and other relevant databases.
•	Key Indicators: GDP, inflation rate, unemployment rate, foreign direct investment (FDI), export and import data, remittances, exchange rates, poverty rate, and population growth.
•	Time Frame: Data spanning the last 20 years(2000-2019) to ensure a comprehensive analysis.
### 3. Data Preparation
•	Cleaning: Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies. Convert all financial figures to a common currency (e.g., USD) if necessary.
•	Transformation: Normalize or scale data where appropriate. Convert time series data to a consistent format for analysis.
•	Feature Engineering: Create new features such as moving averages, growth rates, or economic indices.
### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Trend Analysis: Visualize trends for each economic indicator over time. For example, GDP growth, inflation rate fluctuations, and trade balance over the years.
•	Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between different economic indicators, such as the correlation between inflation and unemployment (Phillips curve) or GDP and FDI.
•	Segmentation: Segment data by different time periods (e.g., pre-2000 vs. post-2000) to analyze structural changes in the economy.
### 5. Visualization
•	Interactive Dashboards: Create interactive dashboards using Power BI to visualize key findings and trends. Include features like filtering by year or indicator.
•	Time Series Plots: Plot time series for each indicator to visualize trends.
•	Heatmaps: Use heatmaps to show the correlation between different economic indicators.
### 6. Insights & Recommendations
•	Economic Trends: Summarize key trends observed in the data, such as periods of rapid growth or economic downturns.
•	Policy Recommendations: Based on the analysis, suggest policy interventions that could help improve economic performance, such as increasing investment in certain sectors or focusing on trade policies.
•	Future Projections: Provide projections for key economic indicators over the next 5-10 years based on the models developed.
### 7. Conclusion
The data analysis provided valuable insights into the economic conditions of Bangladesh over the years. The trends in GDP growth, inflation, government debt, and other key indicators reveal the challenges and opportunities the country has faced. These insights can be crucial for policymakers, economists, and analysts in understanding the factors driving economic growth and in making informed decisions for future economic planning.The analysis and visualizations provide a clear picture of how various economic factors like GDP growth, inflation rate, total investment, unemployment rate, and government debt have evolved over time.
Summarize the key findings of the project, highlighting the most important insights and their implications for Bangladesh's economy. Discuss the limitations of the analysis and potential areas for further research.
